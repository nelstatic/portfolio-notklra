        <p>
          From North-East of Paris, Clara Thion Moreira is a multidisciplinary
          artist primarly working with film photography.
          <br />
          <br /> Through her vision, Clara unveils a new perception of women in
          her imagery.
          <br /> This is particularly evident in her photo series Conex√£o, where
          one feels the suffocating heaviness of absence when our other half is
          no longer there.
